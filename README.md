## Problem / Requirements
I would like to...
- be able to test API endpoints
- be able to make request easily, selecting a HTTP method, url, pass parameters and set headers
- have an easy way to set up Authorisation if needed
- have an lightweight web app that covers my basic needs as opposed to heavy and feature rich app like postman

## Tech stack used to solve
- Express.js to deal with routing to endpoints
- Vue.js frontend
- Vuetify component library

## Learning Outcomes
- Dealing with API calls
- Vue.js framework
- Using a component library to create a consistent and professional look
- Working with docker, creating and running containers, uploading images to DockerHub
